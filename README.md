#### Typically played in an arcade, Whack-a-Mole was a fun way to test your speed. My inspiration for the theme of this project was, "If You Give a Beach a Bottle" by Max Romey

## Instructions

- Welcome!
- Did you know about 8 million pounds of trash get put into the ocean each day? [Reference](https://www.condorferries.co.uk/plastic-in-the-ocean-statistics#:~:text=Every%20day%20around%208%20million,square%20kilometers%20%E2%80%93%20bigger%20than%20Texas)

- This game is a take on the classic game Whack-A-Mole. You must WHACK the trash out of our oceans, this is as simple as find and click. Once you've sucessfully cleaned up the trash your score will increase!
- OK! Let's practice cleaning up, [Click start to begin!](https://cleantheocean.surge.sh/)
